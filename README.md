# FrontEnd Project Tic-Tac-Toe-Game

Tic-tac-toe is played on a three-by-three grid by two players, who alternately place the marks X and O in one of the nine spaces in the grid.
In the following example, the first player (X) wins the game in seven steps.There is no universally agreed rule as to who plays first, but in this article the convention that X plays first is used.
Players soon discover that the best play from both parties leads to a draw.
